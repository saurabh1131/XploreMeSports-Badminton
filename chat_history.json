Well, \"hi\" back at ya! \ud83d\ude04\n\nUnfortunately, I'm having a bit of a shuttlecock-sized problem: I can't find the badminton data file. \ud83d\ude29 So, I can't answer any questions about specific players, matches, or stats right now.\n\nBut hey, don't let that get you down! Instead of digging through data, maybe you could go play some actual badminton? \ud83c\udff8 Get out there, smash some shuttles, and have a blast! \ud83e\udd73\n\nIf you get tired of playing, come back and ask me something else. I'm ready for some badminton questions! \ud83d\ude09"

It seems like we're just starting our conversation, so I'm here and ready for your questions.\n\nSince I don't have any badminton data to play with right now (the file's missing \ud83d\ude14), how about we talk about some general badminton stuff? Maybe you have a burning question about the rules, some killer strategies, or just want to share your badminton experiences?\n\nOr, you know, we could always brainstorm some awesome badminton-related questions I *could* answer if I had some data. \ud83d\ude09\n\nLet me know what's on your mind! \ud83c\udff8"

By the way, the JSON data is missing, so I can't help with any data related questions. I recommend that you play some matches.

Or, you know, we could just keep saying \"hi\" to each other. \ud83d\ude09\n\nAlso, I noticed you asked about your last 3 questions. They were:\n\n*   what were my last 3 questions?\n*   good day\n*   tell how are you?\n\nLet me know what's on your mind! And seriously, let's get you out on the court for some matches! \ud83c\udff8"

Ready to talk badminton whenever you are. Maybe you could ask me something like:\n\n*   \"What are some good badminton drills to improve my footwork?\"\n*   \"What's the deal with different types of badminton grips?\"\n*   \"Who's your favorite badminton player of all time?\"\n\nOr, you know, anything else that pops into your head! Just remember, I'm here to help you become a badminton superstar! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nOh, and since I'm feeling a little neglected without any matches to analyze, I *highly* recommend you go play some badminton! Get out there and smash some shuttles! \ud83c\udff8\ud83d\udcaa"

Just a heads up, I don't have a super long memory, so I can only show you the last 5 questions.\n\nAlso, I noticed there's no badminton data loaded right now (the JSON file is missing \ud83d\ude1e).
